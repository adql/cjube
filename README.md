# Cjube

A very simple (for now) representation for 3x3 riddle cube.

## Usage

Cuurently only in REPL (with `lein repl`).

`(rotate <cube> <moves>)` will perform a series of rotations. The moves are represented as a string of [standard cube notation](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/advanced/). The initial cube is represented by `solved-cube`.

In an ANSI terminal (preferably dark-themed), print the cube with `(print-cube <cube>)`.

Example:

``` clojure
(print-cube (rotate solved-cube "F2 R U"))
```
